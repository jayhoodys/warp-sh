>
>2024.7.18 menu.sh v3.1.0 / warp-go.sh v1.2.0 1. Use self-built warp api: https://warp.cloudflare.now.cc/ to upgrade to Teams account, no need to prepare Token in advance, only need to enter organization, email and verification code when the script is running to complete, the efficiency is greatly increased; 2. Because the Client's settings need to be set up in the Cloudflare dashboard, which can cause the vps to lose contact if not handled properly, the Client's is not upgraded to a Teams account, and the user can look up the information to set it up on their own;

>
>2021.10.14  2.04: 1.LXC users can choose BoringTun or Wireguard-go (BoringTun uses Rust language, performance close to kernel module performance, stability depends on VPS; WireGuard-GO uses Go language, performance is slightly worse than the former, high stability); 2.Add restriction: native dual-stack VPS can only use Warp dual-stack, bash menu.sh 1 will suggest changing to Warp dual-stack or exit; 3.After Warp network disconnection, running warp will automatically close the channel and kill the process; 4.After the script is aborted, use echo $? to display 1, which means unsuccessful (originally 0 representing successful operation)
>
>2021.10.12  2.03: 1.Optimized network brushing, accelerated the interval between two attempts, no dead loops will occur because the number of attempts has been limited to 10 times with clear prompts 2.Use Rust language BoringTun instead of Go language WireGuard-GO
>
>2021.10.10  2.02: The upstream ip.gs uses wget which is unstable and cannot get IP, causing continuous brushing. Abandoned and replaced with curl. The script automatically installs if not found

## Script Features

* Support WARP+ account, with third-party scripts to刷 WARP+ traffic and upgrade kernel BBR
* User-friendly menu for ordinary users, advanced users can quickly build through suffix options
* Intelligent judgment of VPS operating system: Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04; Debian 9, 10, 11, CentOS 7, 8; Alpine and Arch Linux, please be sure to choose LTS system
  Intelligent judgment of hardware structure type: AMD, ARM and s390x
* Combining Linux version and virtualization method, automatically optimize three WireGuard solutions.
  Network performance: Kernel integrated WireGuard > Install kernel module > BoringTun > wireguard-go
* Intelligent judgment of the latest version of WGCF author's github repository (Latest release)
* Intelligent analysis of intranet and public IP to generate WGCF configuration file
* Output results, prompt whether to use WARP IP, IP location

## WARP Benefits

* Support chatGPT, unlock Netflix streaming media
* Avoid Google verification code or use Google Scholar
* Can call IPv4 interface, so that projects such as Qinglong and V2P can run normally
* Since data can be transmitted in both directions, it can be used as a jump board and probe of the other party's VPS, replacing HE tunnelbroker
* Can make nodes built on IPv6 only VPS support Telegram
* Nodes built with IPv6 can be used on PassWall and ShadowSocksR Plus+ that only support IPv4

## How to Brush Netflix Unlock WARP IP

* You can use another one-click script that unlocks streaming media through WARP: [【Brush WARP IP】 - Born for WARP to unlock streaming media](https://github.com/fscarmen/unlock_warp)

* Taking brushing Hong Kong hk as an example, run `warp i`. It is recommended to run in the background with screen or nohup

* If the unlock IP has not been brushed out for a long time, you can check whether CloudFlare is maintaining the route locally: https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/

    <summary> How to unlock chatGPT through WARP (click to expand or collapse)</summary>

The idea is to use the already registered warp to set up chained proxy. This solution is the most lightweight, and users only need xray. The specific method is to modify the outbound and routing of the xray configuration file. The template is as follows:

## WARP+ License and ID Acquisition

The following is the official introduction to Argo 2.0 after using WARP and Team: [Argo 2.0: Smart Routing Learns New Tricks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/argo-v2/)

Quote from Luminous: Actual tests show that WARP+ has no difference from the free version in terms of speed when accessing non-CF websites. Only when accessing CloudFlare sites, the paid version will use Argo-like technology to go to the origin through a data center closer to the target, while the free version is limited to going to the origin from the connection location, that's all.

## How to Obtain and Use WARP Teams for Linux

* https://warp-token.cloudflare.now.cc/ , through fscarmen's website

* https://web--public--warp-team-api--coia-mfs4.code.run/, through Coia's website

## WARP Principle

WARP is a network traffic security and acceleration service based on WireGuard provided by CloudFlare, which can enable you to achieve privacy protection and link optimization by connecting to CloudFlare's edge nodes.

Its connection entry is dual-stack (both IPv4/IPv6 are available), and after connection, you can obtain NAT-based IPv4 and IPv6 addresses provided by CF. Therefore, our single-stack server can try to connect to WARP to obtain additional network connectivity support. This way, we can let servers with only IPv6 access IPv4, and also let servers with only IPv4 obtain IPv6 access capabilities.

* Add IPv4 to IPv6-only servers

As shown in the figure, IPv4 traffic is taken over by the WARP network card, realizing that IPv4 traffic accesses the external network through WARP.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62703343/135735404-1389d022-e5c5-4eb8-9655-f9f065e3c92e.png" width="70%" />

* Add IPv6 to IPv4-only servers

As shown in the figure, IPv6 traffic is taken over by the WARP network card, realizing that IPv6 traffic accesses the external network through WARP.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62703343/135735414-01321b0b-887e-43d6-ad68-a74db20cfe84.png" width="70%" />

* Network replacement for dual-stack servers

Sometimes our server itself is dual-stack, but for various reasons we may not want to use one of the networks. In this case, we can also use WARP to take over part of the network connection to hide our IP address. The purpose of doing this, the biggest significance is to reduce the probability of verification codes appearing in some severely abused data centers; at the same time, some content providers treat WARP's landing IP as the native IP of real users, which can lift some IP-based blockades.
